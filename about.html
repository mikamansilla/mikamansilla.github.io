            <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 22px"; >Hello!<br>
        My name is Mika Mansilla of EC1, a freshman student in De La Salle Univeristy studying Bachelor of Science in Indutrial Engineering. <br><br>
        This website is part of the requirements for our LYBEC2A subject. <br><br>
        A little background about myself, I am the fourth of five children living in a household of 9.
        My family has always been a big part of me growing up - they are my supporters as well as my teachers. My parents especially were the foundation of my being, and I am who I am now because of them. I am forever grateful to have such loving and caring people in my life, and this website is just a little thank you for them. </p>
