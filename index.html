    <h2>A Love Letter</h2>
    <p>No love is more unconditional than the love of our parents. They only want what is best for us, and sometimes this includes not giving in to all our wants. As children, we may not understand how it works, but as we grow older, we slowly see what they mean.<br> <br>
	Having parents who love and care for you is already a blessing as it is. Not everyone has that privilege. However, there are times that we may take them for granted and only talk to them when we need them. We forget our thank you’s, sorry’s, and I love you’s. Some people even find it hard to express their feelings to their parents. So what better way to show them our appreciation than a simple yet personal love letter?<br> <br>
Let us not forget to show our gratitude to them from time to time. A love letter, or even a simple note, would be enough to show your love to your parents. Visit my website to see my own personal love letter to my parents. .</p>
