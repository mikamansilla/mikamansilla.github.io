     <h2>A Poem</h2>
    <p>
“love is patient, love is kind”<br>
this is what you taught me<br>
and it stuck in my mind <br>
when I hurt my sister, or fight a friend <br>
You never shouted, but talked carefully instead <br><br>
        
“Love is not rude, it is not self-seeking”<br>
smiles on your faces, especially when you’re giving<br>
you do what you do because you love to<br>
you do what you do, even if you don't have to<br><br> 

“Love always protects, always trusts”<br>
when I’m  in the wrong, you do what is just<br> 
but you trust me to do what I want again<br>
because you see the best in me, and you support me<br><br> 

Love never fails even if things fall apart <br>
it will endure even through the most difficult times<br> 
Thank you for being our pillars and our bridge <br>
I love you Mama, I love you Papa </p>

    <p>To my mom, <br><br>

Hi Mom! How are you? I know I see you everyday and sleep beside you every night, but I never get to ask how you are. I can see how busy you get with work. But mom, your health is more important that work and I know you know that. Try sleeping before 4 am :( I’m getting worried about you. Every since Papa migrated with Kuya, you stress yourself out more than usual. You try to take all the responsibilities - bringing Alex to school, waking up early to bring her to training, doing the groceries by yourself, and all that. You deserve some rest :( <br><Br>
It wasn’t easy, we know, because Papa used to do all that for us, but now he’s not at home anymore, you feel like you have to take his place. Well we’re here to tell you that you dont have to do that! We’re all grown up kids now who can look after ourselves. You have done more than enough. And because of that, I want to take this opportunity to thank you. Thank you for being patient. Thank you for trusting us with our ways. Thank you for being the Mom and the Dad at home. You are the strongest woman I know, and you serve as my inspiration. I love you Mom. Let us take care of you. <br><br> </p>

    To Papa, <br><br>

Hi pops! It’s been awhile. I know we don’t really talk that often anymore and I kind of miss your laughs and your farts at home. I hope you’re doing well there. Going from 5 children at home to being alone and working must be hard for you :( You don’t show any of that, knowing you, but I already feel homesick just being away from home for a few days. What more 10 months! I hope you can home soon. Thank you for this big sacrifice. Thank you for taking care of us. I never saw how much you did for our family until you left. It’s sad to have taken you for granted like that but we have learned our lesson. I love you pops. Kiss baby Reese and Natalia for me! Hug Kuya and Ate Maine too! hehe. Missing you always!
